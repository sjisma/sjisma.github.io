            considered to be a <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> rather than

            and <a href="#conf">Confucianism</a> had many parallels does not reflect their

            it hard to define each one absolutely. During the time, <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a>

                How was it created?
            </h3>
            <p>
            <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> was a belief created by Siddhartha
            Gautama. Siddhartha is often referred to as Buddha or the
            "enlightened one." Siddhartha Gautama A lot of 
            <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> came from the 
            <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> Hinduism so it does contain aspects of
            non-secularity. Of course, <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> does
            reflect similarities to Hinduism because it was largely based off
            of it, but it also differs because Siddhartha Gautama disagreed
            with some conepts of Hinduism. He mainly disagreed with the
            concepts which contributed to inequality, to be specific, the idea
            of a caste system was removed.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What were <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a>'s main beliefs
            </h3>
            <p>
            Although <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> had many different schools
            with variations of what Buddha had said, each school of
            <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> had one main focus which was to reach
            a state called <a href="#nirvana">Nirvana</a>.  Many Buddhist, in
            order to find the path to <a href="#nirvana">Nirvana</a>, followed
            the teachings of Buddha. These teachings included “the Noble
            Eightfold Path” and “the Four Noble Truths,” which not only
            addressed Buddhist, but also every sentient being. “The Four Noble
            Truths,” in short, explained that people endured constant suffering
            because of desires, so in order to rid oneself of suffering, one
            would have to cease any desires. The concept of
            <a href="#nirvana">Nirvana</a> was deeply ingrained within 
            <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> and was practiced and refined.
            Despite being practiced and refined, <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a>
            split into different schools which had interpreted Buddha’s saying
            differently.  Although <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a>’s branching
            ideas changed in the many years after its establishment, including
            when it had entered China, the core concepts of
            <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> had remained the same.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How did it move to Ancient China
            </h3>
            <p>
            <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> moved to Ancient China under Daoism.
            Many people in China acknowledged <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> as a
            <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> that came from Daoism during the time
            and had misconceptions about Buddha because of mistranslated text
            from the <i>sutra</i>. The <i>sutra</i> was mistranslated because
            Daoist and other similar minded people changed the text to appeal
            to the Chinese so that it would be interpreted as Daoist exotic.
            People began to believe Laozi was the Buddha in the text and even
            misinterpreted Buddhist scripture as the Dao De Jing. As
            <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> became more establish and gained more
            monks and monasteries, better translations of the <i>sutra</i> were
            produced and more followers came to a better realization as to who
            Buddha and what BUddhism was. More and more Chinese youths beame
            followers of <a href="#budd">Buddhism</a> as a result of the better
            translated Buddhist text.

            </h3>
            <p>
            <a href="#conf">Confucianism</a> was created by Confucius. Many
            Confucianist saw Confucius as a sage-teacher, neither a savior nor
            deity.  <a href="#conf">Confucianism</a> began without any part of
            <a href="#R&P">Religion</a> in mind; it never went beyond the
            material world, no creed, worship, god, or conversion system. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                What core concepts did it have
            </h3>
            <p>
            <a href="#conf">Confucianism</a>'s beliefs and teachings were
            completely secular. It had no concepts about rebirth or spiritual
            states like Nirvana. <a href="#conf">Confucianism</a> was moral
            based, its beliefs were that anyone could become a 
            <a href="#junzi">junzi</a> regardless of their status or how they
            were born.  <a href="#conf">Confucianism</a> taught concepts
            regarding human and government life.  In the Confucianist belief,
            human life and politics strived if in accordance of “Do not do to
            others what you would not want others to do to you.”
            </p>
            <p>
            These concepts could be seen as the core concepts as they remained
            consistent throughout the separating schools of
            <a href="#conf">Confucianism</a>. The two well known disciples of
            Confucius were Mengzi and Xunxi. While both were disciples of
            Confucius, their ideas about humanity were completely different.
            Mengzi believed every human was innately good, but they had to get
            their goodness back from greed and also stressed kindness to the
            government. Xunxi, on the other hand, believed that all men were
            innately evil and had to study goodness to achieve it.  Despite
            their ideas about humanity being polar opposite, neither argued
            about who could become good or a <a href="#junzi">junzi</a>.
